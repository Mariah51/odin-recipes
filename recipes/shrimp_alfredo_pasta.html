        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>The rich, creamy texture of the alfredo sauce with the combination of the tender shrimps is a simple yet delicious dish. The flavour of the sauce is a tangy taste from the Parmesan cheese along with the mild combination of the buttery, salty, and sweet shrimps that are in the dish.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) jar Alfredo-style pasta sauce</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>

        </ul>
